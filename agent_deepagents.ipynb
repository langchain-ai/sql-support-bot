    "\n",
    "**LangGraph approach (original):**\n",
    "- Manual routing with conditional edges\n",
    "- Explicit state management\n",
    "- Define every transition between agents\n",
    "- More control, more code\n",
    "\n",
    "**DeepAgents approach (this version):**\n",
    "- Autonomous routing - agent decides which tools/subagents to use\n",
    "- Built-in planning and context management\n",
    "- Less code, more reliance on LLM intelligence\n",
    "- Trade-off: ~20x more tokens but faster wall-clock time\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows both a simple single-agent approach and an advanced subagent approach."
